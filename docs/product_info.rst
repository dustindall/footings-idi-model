From an actuarial perspective, individual disablity insurance (IDI) carry two key reserves. 
They are - 

1. Active life reserves (ALRs)—for claims that have not yet been incurred. Key morbidity
assumptions are claim incidence rates (probability of becoming disabled) and claim termination 
rates (probability of recovering or dying). ALRs are held for contracts when net premiums
prefund future claim costs. This occurs when premiums are level and claim costs are non-level,
but also may occur with other premium structures.

2. Disabled life reserve (DLRs)—for claims that have been incurred. The key morbidity assumption
is claim termination rates. DLRs are held to recognize the full present value of the expected claim
payments for claims that have been incurred. 

Both definitions are sourced from the December 2015 report - *Individual Disability Valuation Standard* 
*Report of the Joint American Academy of Actuaries/Society of Actuaries Individual Disability*
